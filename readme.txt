== Description ==

This plugin determines whether any of your plugins have security vulnerabilities.  It does this by looking up details in the WPScan Vulnerability Database.

It adds a new menu option to the admin tools menu called "Plugin Security Scanner".  Clicking this runs a scan.  If the scan finds any problems, it shows you a list of plugins that have vulnerabilities, along with a description of the issue.
